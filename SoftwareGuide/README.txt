INSIGHT TOOLKIT SOFTWARE GUIDE BUILD OVERVIEW

The generation of the ITK Software Guide is orchestrated as a CMake superubild
process. CMakeLists.txt files are placed in the directories involved on the
build process. As any other CMake-managed process, the results of the build
process are put in a binary tree corresponding to the source tree.

The following dependencies are required to build ITK Software Guide on Linux or
Windows platforms:

 - Git
 - Python
 - ImageMagick
   Windows installer can be found here: http://www.imagemagick.org/.
 - LaTeX and BibTeX
   See the preamble of the LaTeX/00-SoftwareGuide.tex file for the full list of
   required LaTeX packages. Among these packages Minted package for syntax
   highlighting in its turn depends on a Python package Pygments. Instructions
   for installing Minted and Pygments packages on Windows are available here:
   https://minted.googlecode.com/files/minted.pdf.
 - dvips, ps2pdf
   While on Linux platforms these tools are usually included with most
   distributions, on Windows platforms they are usually included in MikTex Latex
   distribution.

ITK Software Guide is generated with Latex by using input from a variety of
source code files and images:

 1. LaTeX files found in SoftwareGuide/LaTeX
 2. JPEG, PNG and EPS files in SoftwareGuide/Art
 3. PNG files generated as the result of compiling and running the examples
    included in the ITK source code
 3. ITK examples source code cxx files where the comments delimited with
    BeginLaTeX, EndLaTeX and BeginCodeSnippet, EndCodeSnippet have been written
    specifically to be included in the ITK Software Guide; the regular LaTeX
    files in SoftwareGuide/LaTeX include the LaTeX files generated from the ITK
    examples source code.

Following is a brief description of the build process:

 1. The source code of ITK 4 is downloaded and built (including ITK examples)
    in the binary output directory.
 2. JPEG and PNG files in the Art directory are converted to EPS using
    ImageMagic tools; the resulting EPS files are saved in the Art directory in
    the binary output directory.
 3. PNG files are generated by running ITK examples and converted to EPS using
    MagicTools; the resulting EPS files are saved in Art/Generated directory of
    the binary output directory.
 4. A Python script SoftwareGuide/ParseCxxExamples.py is invoked to extract the
    comments in the ITK examples source file delimited with BeginLaTeX, EndLaTeX
    and BeginCodeSnippet, EndCodeSnippet and generate LaTeX files which are
    copied into the Examples subdirectory of the binary output directory.
 5. The top-level LaTeX file SoftwareGuide/LaTeX/000-ITKSoftwareGuide-Book1.tex is
    compiled with a series of calls to latex, bibtex, latex, makeindex, dvips,
    and ps2pdf to generate the PDF file.

CONFIGURING AND BUILDING WITH CMAKE

Following is the description how to configure and build ITK Software Guide using
CMake:

 1. Run cmake-gui and specify input and binary output directories.
    Alternatively, create the binary output directory and run
    "ccmake source_dir" where source_dir is the full path of the
    ITKSoftwareGuide directory.
 2. Configure and generate the project for the target platform.
 3. Build SuperBuild_ITKSoftwareGuide project as appropriate for the target
    platform.

TROUBLESHOOTING

 1. Build process will fail if CMake is unable to locate any of the
    dependencies. In this case a close examination of the error messages might
    provide a clue as to which dependency is failing.

 2. Frustrated by the build taking a long time to complete
   ... no solution here. :)
