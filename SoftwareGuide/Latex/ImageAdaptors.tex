The purpose of Image Adaptors is to make an image object of a particular type
to look like another type of image. A typical example is to take an image of
pixel type \code{unsigned char} and make it look like an image of pixel type
\code{float}. The motivation for using Image Adaptors is to prevent the memory
overload that normaly will be produced by a casting filter. If you use the
\doxygen{CastImageFilter} for converting an \code{unsigned char} image into a
\doxygen{float} one, the filter will duplicate the memory buffer required for
storing the image, given that \code{float}s require four times more memory than
\code{unsigned char}s, the memory consumption will actually be multiplied by
four. An ImageAdaptor will prevent this memory replication and will convert
pixel values only when they are read using image iterators (see
chapter~\ref{sec:ImageIteratorsChapter}).

ImageAdaptors can replace any of the pixel-wise filters in the toolkit. They
are defined for most of the basic single valued and single parameter functions
like trigonometric functions, exponential and logarithms.
