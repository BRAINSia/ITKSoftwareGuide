This is a list of topics to be added to the Software Guide.




Chapter 1



Add more on the "Data" section: expand it in order to mention


  - IBSR repository: add a paragraph, how to get their data,
      how to read it with ITK. And add a \ref{} to ImageIO 
      chapter and MetaImages.



  - BrainWeb repository: add a paragraph, how the get their data.
      how to read it  using MetaImage.



  - MIRC (RSNA).  www.rsna.org/mirc  add a paragraph about it.



 Mention that the reader has to go to the ImageIO chapter in order 
 to learn about all the fileformats in ITK.






Chapter 2

      Intel (Linux, Windows),  7.1, 8.0
      Sun native CC 5.6 
      SGI 7.4 (??) check with Bill Lorensen
      Mac GCC 3.3
      Free VC++

     Add CMake screen shots for the Mac (from Jon).








Chapter 3


    Check with Will...






Chapter 4    Data Representation





   - 4.1.4 Update it to mention OriginType and SpacingType instead of
     arrays of doubles and/or floats.





  - 4.1.7  Import Data to image

     Take from the tutorial and build up this section

     http://www.itk.org/CourseWare/Training/GettingStarted-V.pdf


     Explain how to put an ITK pipeline inside a C function and
     prevent the output image from being destroyed.

     Add... source code examples to the CVS Examples directory.



     



  Mesh

     

     - Double check that the AutomaticMesh example works as advertised...



    -  Double check that all the examples are still working...



    - Check with Will about the AutoPointer...  maybe remove the 
      notation of TakeOwnership,... check with vtkAbstracCell.



   - Add example on how to use the Neighborhood links

     
           BuildCellLinks()


   - Add section on the Simplex 
     (check Leila Baghdadi, and Thomas Boettger).


   - Graph cuts (liver segmentation).
     check mailing list archives, check the Voronoi.





Chapter 5  Spatial Objects


    Coordinate with Julien Jomier at UNC. 
    They plan to update this section.

    e.g. add the ImageMaskSpatialObject.




    

      
    

Chapter 6 Filtering



   - in Thresholding add examples:

       OtsuThresholdImageCalculator (using it alone)
       OtsuThresholdImageFilter (already there, but needs refinement).

       OtsuMultipleThreshold Calculator (using it alone).
       OtsuMultipeleThreshodl Filter (add example + filter).






 - 6.2.1 Casting filters (low priority)

     spliting CastImageFilter into 4 separate .cxx
     
     and check if we have other casting filters...


      
 - Double check equation pdf-page 147. Equations were correctd.




 - Mathematical morphology, 

     add Examples for the new filters that Jim Miller (GE)
     added recently


         GrayScaleFillHoleImageFilter
         GrayScaleGrindPeakImageFilter
         GrayScaleConnecteOpeningImageFilter
         GrayScaleConnecteCloseningImageFilter
         GrayScaleGeodesicDilateImageFilter
         GrayScaleGeodesicErodeImageFilter



- FFT examples. 

        Maybe add a couple more examples...
        
        at least comment the existing ones
        and generate output example images.



- RecursiveGaussianImage filter DC component bug, keep track
  of it during the example. check BUG in the bug tracker.





- Voting filters

  
    Add examples for Voting filters
    HoleFilling



- Add example for BinaryMedianImageFilter, take a noisy
  segmentation (e.g. plain thresholding) and then post-
  process it with this filter.

  




- Discrete Gaussian needs to fix the graphic according
  to the original. Check with Jim Miller, to get the
  paper.



  

- Check with Andy : capture the command line used for running
  the regression testing and paste it on Latex.



- Edge preserving filtering: move the Median filter here,
  and show the effect of running many iterations of a median.
  Explain its relationship to Voting filters.



- MinMaxCurvatureFlowImage check this example,
  Ask Lydia what was wrong with the example.




- Signed distance based on running Danielsson twice,

  Mention that the same can be done with ReinitializeLevelSetImageFilter
  ...maybe add an example...
  http://www.itk.org/Insight/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1ReinitializeLevelSetImageFilter.html

  Check with Lydia (Brain Allen Institue) and/or Josh Cates (Utah)



- Geometric Transform Filters

  Double check that the changes in CenteredTransforms are not breaking
  any code, and that the comments are appropriate.






Chapter 7 IO



- Update Figure 7.3 to add all the known fileformats

- Add a table withh all  the fileformat from the FAQ in Wiki.

- Add the examples for Series Read Write:

  The .cxx are there, they need to:

    1. Revision of their comments
    2. Make sure they have regression testing.
    3. Make sure they are input in Latex
    
    
  - ImageReadImageSeriesWrite.cxx
  - ImageSeriesReadWrite.cxx
  - RGBImageSeriesReadWrite.cxx
  

- Add a section on DICOM

  - Maybe introduction by Mathieu 
    - short history, web site, standards.
      JPEG compression... etc.

  - How to read single DICOM slice
  - How to write single DICOM slice
  - How to read a DICOM series 
  - How to write a DICOM series 
  - How to printout an entire DICOM header
  - How to get specific entries.

    DicomSeriesReadImageWrite.cxx
    DicomSeriesReadImageWrite2.cxx
    DicomSeriesReadPrintTags.cxx
    DicomSeriesReadSeriesWrite.cxx
