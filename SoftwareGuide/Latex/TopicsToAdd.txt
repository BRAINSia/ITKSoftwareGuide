This is a list of topics to be added to the Software Guide.




Chapter 1



Add more on the "Data" section: expand it in order to mention


  - IBSR repository: add a paragraph, how to get their data,
      how to read it with ITK. And add a \ref{} to ImageIO 
      chapter and MetaImages.



  - BrainWeb repository: add a paragraph, how the get their data.
      how to read it  using MetaImage.



  - MIRC (RSNA).  www.rsna.org/mirc  add a paragraph about it.



 Mention that the reader has to go to the ImageIO chapter in order 
 to learn about all the fileformats in ITK.






Chapter 2


- Update list of compilers

     
      Intel (Linux, Windows),  7.1, 8.0
      Sun native CC 5.6 
      SGI 7.4 (??) check with Bill Lorensen
      Mac GCC 3.3
      Free VC++
      Visual Studio  6.0 ,  7.0,   7.1
      Borland 5.5
      MinGW  gcc
      Cygwin gcc 



 - Configuration:

     Add CMake screen shots for the Mac (from Jon).








Chapter 3


    Check with Will...






Chapter 4    Data Representation





   - 4.1.4 Update it to mention OriginType and SpacingType instead of
     arrays of doubles and/or floats.





  - 4.1.7  Import Data to image

     Take from the tutorial and build up this section

     http://www.itk.org/CourseWare/Training/GettingStarted-V.pdf


     Explain how to put an ITK pipeline inside a C function and
     prevent the output image from being destroyed.

     Add... source code examples to the CVS Examples directory.



     



  Mesh

     

     - Double check that the AutomaticMesh example works as advertised...



    -  Double check that all the examples are still working...



    - Check with Will about the AutoPointer...  maybe remove the 
      notation of TakeOwnership,... check with vtkAbstracCell.



   - Add example on how to use the Neighborhood links

     
           BuildCellLinks()


   - Add section on the Simplex 
     (check Leila Baghdadi, and Thomas Boettger).


   - Graph cuts (liver segmentation).
     check mailing list archives, check the Voronoi.





Chapter 5  Spatial Objects


    Coordinate with Julien Jomier at UNC. 
    They plan to update this section.

    e.g. add the ImageMaskSpatialObject.




    

      
    

Chapter 6 Filtering



   - in Thresholding add examples:

       OtsuThresholdImageCalculator (using it alone)
       OtsuThresholdImageFilter (already there, but needs refinement).

       OtsuMultipleThreshold Calculator (using it alone).
       OtsuMultipeleThreshodl Filter (add example + filter).






 - 6.2.1 Casting filters (low priority)

     spliting CastImageFilter into 4 separate .cxx
     
     and check if we have other casting filters...


      
 - Double check equation pdf-page 147. Equations were correctd.




 - Mathematical morphology, 

     add Examples for the new filters that Jim Miller (GE)
     added recently


         GrayScaleFillHoleImageFilter
         GrayScaleGrindPeakImageFilter
         GrayScaleConnecteOpeningImageFilter
         GrayScaleConnecteCloseningImageFilter
         GrayScaleGeodesicDilateImageFilter
         GrayScaleGeodesicErodeImageFilter
