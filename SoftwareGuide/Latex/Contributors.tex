The Insight Toolkit \href{http://www.itk.org}{(ITK)} has been created by the
efforts of many talented individuals and prestigious organizations. It is also
due in great part to the vision of the program established by Dr. Terry Yoo
and Dr. Michael Ackerman at the National Library of Medicine.

This book lists a few of these contributors in the following paragraphs. Not
all developers of ITK are credited here, please visit the Web pages at
