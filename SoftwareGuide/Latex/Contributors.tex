The Insight Toolkit \href{http://www.itk.org}{(ITK)} has been created by the
efforts of many talented individuals and prestigious organizations. It is also
due in great part to the vision of the program established by Dr. Terry Yoo
and Dr. Michael Ackerman at the National Library of Medicine.

This book lists a few of these contributors in the following paragraphs. Not
all developers of ITK are credited here, please visit the Web pages at
\href{http://www.itk.org/HTML/About.htm}{http://www.itk.org/HTML/About.htm} 
for the names of additional contributors, as well as checking the CVS source
logs for code contributions.

The following is a brief description of the contributors to this software
guide and their contributions.

{\bf Dr. Luis Luis Ib\'{a}\~{n}ez} is principal author of this text.
He assisted in the design and layout of the text, implemented the bulk of

of this text and the \code{Insight/Examples} directory. He is principle 
content editor, and has authored several chapters.

{\bf Dr. Lydia Ng} authored the description for the registration framework and
its components, the section on the multiresolution framework and deformable
registration methods. She also edited the section on the resampling image
filter and various level set segmentation algorithms.

{\bf Joshua Cates} authored the material describing watersheds and their
application, the section on image iterators, and coauthored the level-set 
segmentation algorithm material.

{\bf Jisung Kim} authored the chapter on the Statistics framework.

{\bf Julien Jomier} contributed examples on Model based registration using
spatial objects.

{\bf Dr. Stephen Aylward}  contributed material describing spatial objects and
their application.

{\bf Tessa Sundaram} contributed the section on deformable registration using
the finite element method.

{\bf YinPeng Jin} contributed the examples on  hybrid segmentation methods. 

{\bf Dr. Celina Imielinska} authored the section describing the principles of
hybrid segmentation methods.
