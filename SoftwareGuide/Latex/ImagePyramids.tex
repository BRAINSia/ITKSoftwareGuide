In ITK, the \code{MultiResolutionPyramidImageFilter} can be used to create a
sequence of downsampled version of the input image.  The downsampling is done
according to a user defined multi-resolution schedule. The schedule is
specified as an \code{Array<int>} containing shrink factors for each
multi-resolution level (rows) for each dimension (column).
