\label{sec:IO}

This chapter describes the toolkit architecture supporting reading and
writing of images to files. ITK does not enforce any particular file format,
instead, it provides a structure supporting a variety of formats that can
be easily extended by the user as new formats become available.

We begin the chapter with some simple examples of file I/O.

The following section describes the internals of the IO architecture provided
in the toolkit.

\section{Pluggable Factories}
\label{sec:ImageIOPluggableFactories}

The principle behind the input/output mechanism used in ITK is known as
\emph{pluggable-factories} \cite{Gamma1995}. This concept is illustrated in
the UML diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOCollaborationDiagram}. From the
user's point of view the objects responsible for reading and writing files
are the \doxygen{ImageFileReader} and \doxygen{ImageFileWriter}
classes. These two classes, however, are not aware of the details involved in
reading or writing particular file formats like PNG or DICOM.  What they do
is to dispatch the user's requests to a set of specific classes that are
aware of the details of image file formats. These classes are the
\doxygen{ImageIO} classes. The ITK delegation mechanism enables users to
extend the number of supported file formats by just adding new classes to the
ImageIO hierarchy.

Each instance of ImageFileReader and ImageFileWriter has
a pointer to an ImageIO object. If this pointer is empty, it will
be impossible to read or write an image and the image file reader/writer must
determine which ImageIO class to use to perform IO operations.
This is done basically by passing the filename to a centralized class, the
\doxygen{ImageIOFactory} and asking it to identify any subclass of
ImageIO capable of reading or writing the user-specified file. This
is illustrated by the use cases on the right side of
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesUseCases}.

Each class derived from ImageIO must provide an associated factory
class capable of producing an instance of the ImageIO class. For
example, for PNG files, there is a \doxygen{PNGImageIO} object that knows how
to read this image files and there is a \doxygen{PNGImageIOFactory} class
capable of constructing a PNGImageIO object and returning a pointer
to it.  Each time a new file format is added (i.e., a new ImageIO
subclass is created), a factory must be implemented as a derived class of the
ImageIOFactory class as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesClassDiagram}.

For example, in order to read PNG files, a PNGImageIOFactory is
created and registered with the central ImageIOFactory
singleton\footnote{\emph{Singleton} means that there is only one instance of
this class in a particular application} class as illustrated in the left side
of Figure~\ref{fig:ImageIOFactoriesUseCases}. When the ImageFileReader asks
the ImageIOFactory for an ImageIO capable of reading the
file identified with \emph{filename} the ImageIOFactory will iterate over the
list of registered factories and will ask each one of them is they know how
to read the file. The factory that responds affirmatively will be used to
create the specific ImageIO instance that will be returned to the
ImageFileReader and used to perform the read operations.

In most cases the mechanism is transparent to the user who onlt interacts
with the ImageFileReader and ImageFileWriter. It is
possible, however, to explicitly select the type of ImageIO object
to use.  This is illustrated by the following example.
