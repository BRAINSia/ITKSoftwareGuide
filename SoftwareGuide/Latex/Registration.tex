This chapter introduces ITK's capabilities for performing image
registration. Image registration is the process of determining the spatial
transform that maps points from one image to homologous points on a object in
the second image. This concept is schematically represented in Figure
\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationConcept}. In ITK, registration is performed within
a framework of pluggable components that can easily be interchanged.  This
flexibility means that a combinatorial variety of registration methods can be
created, allowing the user to pick and choose the right tools for the
application.


\section{Registration Framework}
The components of the registration framework and their interconnections 
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:RegistrationComponents}. The basic
input data to the registration process are two images: one
is defined as the \emph{fixed} image $f(\bf{X})$ and the other as the
\emph{moving} image $m(\bf{X})$. Registration is treated as an optimization problem
with the goal of finding the spatial mapping that will bring the moving image into 
alignment with the fixed image.

\itkcaption[Registration Framework Components]{The basic components of the
registration framework are two input images, a transform, a metric, an
interpolator and an optimizer.}
\label{fig:RegistrationComponents}
\end{figure}

The \emph{transform} component $T(\bf{X})$ represents the spatial mapping of
points from the fixed image space to points in the moving image space. Note
that this definition is inverse to the usual view of image transformation.
Using the \emph{inverse} transform is typical in registration as it avoids the
potential problems of ``holes'' with the forward transform. The \emph{interpolator}
is used to evaluate moving image intensity at non-grid positions. The
\emph{metric} component $S(f,m \circ T)$ provides a measure of how well the
fixed image is matched by the transformed moving image. This measure forms the
quantitative criterion to be optimized by the \emph{optimizer} over the search
space defined by the parameters of the \emph{transform}.

These various ITK registration components will be described in later
sections.  First, we begin with some simple registration examples.

This section presents a discussion on the two most common difficulties that
users encounter when they start using the ITK registration framework. They are,
in order of difficulty

\begin{itemize}
\item The direction of the Transform mapping
\item The fact that registration is done in physical coordinates
\end{itemize}

Probably the reason why these two topics tend to create confusion is that they
are implemented in different ways in other systems and therefore users tend to
have a different expectation on how things should work in ITK. The situation
is exacerbated by the fact that most people describe image operations as if
they were manually performed in a picture in paper.

\subsection{Direction of the Transform Mapping}

The Transform that is optimized in the registration framework is the one that
maps points from the physical space of the fixed image into the physical space
of the moving image. This is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationCoordinateSystemsDiagram}. This implies that
the Transform will accept as input points from the fixed image and it will
compute the coordinates of the analogous points in the moving image. What tends
to create confusion is the fact that when the Transform shifts a point on the
\textbf{positive} X direction, the visual effect of this mapping, once the
moving image is resampled, is equivalent to {\em manually shifting} the moving
image along the \textbf{negative} X direction. In the same way, when the
Transform applies a \textbf{clock-wise} rotation to the fixed image points, the
visual effect of this mapping once the moving image has been resampled is
equivalent to {\em manually rotating} the moving image
\textbf{counter-clock-wise}. 

The reason why this direction of mapping has been chosen for the ITK
implementation of the registration framework is that this is the direction that
better fits the fact that the moving image is expected to be resampled using
the grid of the fixed image. The nature of the resampling process is such that
an algorithm must go through every pixel of the \textbf{fixed} image and
compute the intensity that should be assigned to this pixel from the mapping of
the moving image. This computation involves to take the integral coordinates of
the pixel in the image grid, usually called the ``(i,j)'' coordinates, map them
into the physical space of the fixed image, then map those physical coordinates
into the physical space of the moving image, then mapping the physical
coordinates of the moving image in to the integral coordinates of the discrete
grid of the moving image, where the value of the pixel intensity will be
computed by interpolation. This sequence of steps is described in
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationCoordinateSystemsDiagram}.

If we have used the Transform that maps coordinates from the moving image
physical space into the fixed image physical space, then the resampling process
could not 0 that every pixel in the grid of the fixed image was going
to receive one and only one value. In other words, the resampling will have
resulted in an image with holes and with redundant or overlapped pixel values.

As you have seen in the previous examples, and you will corroborate in the
remaining examples in this chapter, the Transform computed by the registration
framework is the transform that can be used directly in the resampling filter
in order to map the moving image into the grid of the fixed image.

There are exceptional cases in which the transform that you want is actually
the inverse transform of the one computed by the ITK registration framework.
Only in those cases you may have to recur to invoking the \code{GetInverse}
method that most transform offer.  Make sure that before you consider following
that dark path, you interact with the examples of resampling illustrated in
section~\ref{sec:GeometricalTransformationFilters}

\section{ Centered Transforms }

The ITK image coordinate origin is typically located in one of the image
corners. This results in counter-intuitive transform behavior when
rotations and scaling are involved. Users tend to assume that rotations and
scaling are performed around a fixed point at the center of the image.  In
order to compensate for this difference in natural interpretation, a set of
\emph{centered} transforms have been introduced into the toolkit. The following
sections describe the main characteristics of such transforms.

\section{Multi-Resolution Registration}
\label{sec:MultiResolutionRegistration}
Performing image registration using a multi-resolution approach is widely used
to improve speed, accuracy and robustness. The basic idea is that registration
is first performed at a coarse scale where the images have fewer pixels.
The spatial mapping determined at the coarse level is then used to initialize
registration at the next finer scale. This process is repeated until it
reaches the finest possible scale. This coarse-to-fine strategy greatly
improve the registration success rate and also increases robustness
by eliminating local optima at coarser scales.

The Insight Toolkit offers a multi-resolution registration framework that is
directly compatible with all the registration framework components. The
multi-resolution registration framework has two additional components: a pair
of \emph{image pyramids} that are used to down-sample the fixed and moving
images as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:MultiResRegistrationComponents}.
The pyramids smooth and subsample the images according to user-defined
scheduling of shrink factors.
