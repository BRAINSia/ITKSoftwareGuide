This chapter introduces ITK's capabilities for performing image
registration. Image registration is the process of determining the spatial
transform that maps points from one image to homologous points on a object in
the second image. This concept is schematically represented in Figure
\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationConcept}. In ITK, registration is performed within
a framework of pluggable components that can easily be interchanged.  This
flexibility means that a combinatorial variety of registration methods can be
created, allowing the user to pick and choose the right tools for the
application.


\section{Registration Framework}
The components of the registration framework and their interconnections 
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:RegistrationComponents}. The basic
input data to the registration process are two images: one
is defined as the \emph{fixed} image $f(\bf{X})$ and the other as the
\emph{moving} image $m(\bf{X})$. Registration is treated as an optimization problem
with the goal of finding the spatial mapping that will bring the moving image into 
alignment with the fixed image.

registration framework are two input images, a transform, a metric, an
interpolator and an optimizer.}
\label{fig:RegistrationComponents}
\end{figure}

The \emph{transform} component $T(\bf{X})$ represents the spatial mapping of
points from the fixed image space to points in the moving image space. Note
that this definition is inverse to the usual view of image transformation.
Using the \emph{inverse} transform is typical in registration as it avoids the
potential problems of ``holes'' with the forward transform. The \emph{interpolator}
is used to evaluate moving image intensity at non-grid positions. The
\emph{metric} component $S(f,m \circ T)$ provides a measure of how well the
fixed image is matched by the transformed moving image. This measure forms the
quantitative criterion to be optimized by the \emph{optimizer} over the search
space defined by the parameters of the \emph{transform}.

These various ITK registration components will be described in later
sections.  First, we begin with some simple registration examples.

\section{ Centered Transforms }

The ITK image coordinate origin is typically located in one of the image
corners. This results in counter-intuitive transform behavior when
rotations and scaling are involved. Users tend to assume that rotations and
scaling are performed around a fixed point at the center of the image.  In
order to compensate for this difference in natural interpretation, a set of
\emph{centered} transforms have been introduced into the toolkit. The following
sections describe the main characteristics of such transforms.

\section{Multi-Resolution Registration}
\label{sec:MultiResolutionRegistration}
Performing image registration using a multi-resolution approach is widely used
to improve speed, accuracy and robustness. The basic idea is that registration
is first performed at a coarse scale where the images have fewer pixels.
The spatial mapping determined at the coarse level is then used to initialize
registration at the next finer scale. This process is repeated until it
reaches the finest possible scale. This coarse-to-fine strategy greatly
improve the registration success rate and also increases robustness
by eliminating local optima at coarser scales.

The Insight Toolkit offers a multi-resolution registration framework that is
directly compatible with all the registration framework components. The
multi-resolution registration framework has two additional components: a pair
of \emph{image pyramids} that are used to down-sample the fixed and moving
images as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:MultiResRegistrationComponents}.
The pyramids smooth and subsample the images according to user-defined
scheduling of shrink factors.

We now present the main capabilities of the multi-resolution framework by
