This chapter introduces ITK's capabilities for performing image
registration. Image registration is the process of determining the spatial
transform that maps points from one image to homologous points on a object in
the second image. This concept is schematically represented in Figure
\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationConcept}. In ITK, registration is performed within
a framework of pluggable components that can easily be interchanged.  This
flexibility means that a combinatorial variety of registration methods can be
created, allowing users to pick and choose the right tools for their specific
application.


\section{Registration Framework}
The components of the registration framework and their interconnections are
shown in Figure \ref{fig:RegistrationComponents}. The basic input data to the
registration process are two images: one is defined as the \emph{fixed} image
$f(\bf{X})$ and the other as the \emph{moving} image $m(\bf{X})$. Where
$\bf{X}$ represents a position in N-dimensional space. Registration is treated
as an optimization problem with the goal of finding the spatial mapping that
will bring the moving image into alignment with the fixed image.

\itkcaption[Registration Framework Components]{The basic components of the
registration framework are two input images, a transform, a metric, an
interpolator and an optimizer.}
\label{fig:RegistrationComponents}
\end{figure}

The \emph{transform} component $T(\bf{X})$ represents the spatial mapping of
points from the fixed image space to points in the moving image space. The
\emph{interpolator} is used to evaluate moving image intensities at non-grid
positions. The \emph{metric} component $S(f,m \circ T)$ provides a measure of
how well the fixed image is matched by the transformed moving image. This
measure forms the quantitative criterion to be optimized by the
\emph{optimizer} over the search space defined by the parameters of the
\emph{transform}.

These various ITK registration components will be described in later
sections.  First, we begin with some simple registration examples.

This section presents a discussion on the two most common difficulties that
users encounter when they start using the ITK registration framework. They are,
in order of difficulty

\begin{itemize}
\item The direction of the Transform mapping
\item The fact that registration is done in physical coordinates
\end{itemize}

Probably the reason why these two topics tend to create confusion is that they
are implemented in different ways in other systems and therefore users tend to
have different expectations regarding how things should work in ITK. The
situation is further complicated by the fact that most people describe image
operations as if they were manually performed in a picture in paper.

\subsection{Direction of the Transform Mapping}
\label{sec:DirectionOfTheTransformMapping}

The Transform that is optimized in the ITK registration framework is the one
that maps points from the physical space of the fixed image into the physical
space of the moving image. This is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationCoordinateSystemsDiagram}. This implies that
the Transform will accept as input points from the fixed image and it will
compute the coordinates of the analogous points in the moving image. What tends
to create confusion is the fact that when the Transform shifts a point on the
\textbf{positive} X direction, the visual effect of this mapping, once the
moving image is resampled, is equivalent to {\em manually shifting} the moving
image along the \textbf{negative} X direction. In the same way, when the
Transform applies a \textbf{clock-wise} rotation to the fixed image points, the
visual effect of this mapping once the moving image has been resampled is
equivalent to {\em manually rotating} the moving image
\textbf{counter-clock-wise}. 

The reason why this direction of mapping has been chosen for the ITK
implementation of the registration framework is that this is the direction that
better fits the fact that the moving image is expected to be resampled using
the grid of the fixed image. The nature of the resampling process is such that
an algorithm must go through every pixel of the {\em fixed} image and compute
the intensity that should be assigned to this pixel from the mapping of the
{\em moving} image. This computation involves taking the integral coordinates
of the pixel in the image grid, usually called the ``(i,j)'' coordinates,
mapping them into the physical space of the fixed image (transform \textbf{T1}
in Figure~\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationCoordinateSystemsDiagram}), mapping those
physical coordinates into the physical space of the moving image (Transform to
be optimized), then mapping the physical coordinates of the moving image in to
the integral coordinates of the discrete grid of the moving image (transform
\textbf{T2} in the figure), where the value of the pixel intensity will be
computed by interpolation. 

If we have used the Transform that maps coordinates from the moving image
physical space into the fixed image physical space, then the resampling process
could not guarantee that every pixel in the grid of the fixed image was going
to receive one and only one value. In other words, the resampling will have
resulted in an image with holes and with redundant or overlapped pixel values.

As you have seen in the previous examples, and you will corroborate in the
remaining examples in this chapter, the Transform computed by the registration
framework is the Transform that can be used directly in the resampling filter
in order to map the moving image into the discrete grid of the fixed image.

There are exceptional cases in which the transform that you want is actually
the inverse transform of the one computed by the ITK registration framework.
Only in those cases you may have to recur to invoking the \code{GetInverse()}
method that most transform offer.  Make sure that before you consider following
that dark path, you interact with the examples of resampling illustrated in
section~\ref{sec:GeometricalTransformationFilters} in order to get familiar
with the correct interpretation of the transforms.


\subsection{Registration is done in physical space}
\label{sec:RegistrationIsDoneInPhysicalSpace}

The second common difficulty that users encounter with the ITK registration
framework is related to the fact that ITK performs registration in the context
of physical space and not in the discrete space of the image grid.
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationCoordinateSystemsDiagram} show this concept by
crossing the transform that goes between the two image grids. One important
consequence of this fact is that having the correct image origin and image
pixel size is fundamental for the success of the registration process in ITK.
Users must make sure that they provide correct values for the origin and
spacing of both the fixed and moving images.

A typical case that helps to understand this issue, is to consider the
registration of two images where one has a pixel size different from the other.
For example, a PET\footnote{Positron Emission Tomography} image and a
CT\footnote{Computer Tomography in X-rays} image. Typically a CT image will
have a pixel size in the order of 1 millimeter, while a PET image will have a
pixel size in the order of 5 millimeters to 1 centimeter. Therefore, the CT
will need about 500 pixels in order to cover the extent across a human brain, while
the PET image will only have about 50 pixels for covering the same physical
extent of a human brain. 

A user performing registration between a PET image and a CT image may be
naively expecting that because the PET image has less pixels, a {\em scaling}
factor is required in the Transform in order to map this image into the CT
image. At that point, this person is attempting to interpret the registration
process directly between the two image grids, or in {\em pixel space}. What ITK
will do in this case is to take into account the pixel size that the user has
provided and it will use that pixel size in order to compute a scaling factor
for Transforms {\em T1} and {\em T2} in
Figure~\ref{fig:ImageRegistrationCoordinateSystemsDiagram}. Since these two
transforms take care of the required scaling factor, the spatial Transform to
be computed during the registration process does not need to be concerned about
such scaling. The transform that ITK is computing is the one that will
physically map the brain from the moving image into the brain of the fixed
image.

In order to better understand this concepts, it is very useful to draw sketches
of the fixed and moving image {\em at scale} in the same physical coordinate
system. That is the geometrical configuration that the ITK registration
framework uses as context. Keeping this in mind helps a lot for interpreting
correctly the results of a registration process performed with ITK.

\section{Multi-Modality Registration}
\label{sec:MultiModalityRegistration}

Some of the most challenging cases of image registration arise when images of
different modalities are involved. In such cases, metrics based on direct
comparison of gray levels are not applicable. It has been extensively shown
that metrics based on the evaluation of mutual information are well suited for
overcoming the difficulties of multi-modality registration.

\index{itk::Image\-Registration\-Method!Multi-Modality}

The concept of Mutual Information is derived from Information Theory and its
application to image registration has been proposed in different forms by
different groups \cite{Collignon1995,Maes97,Viola1997}, a more detailed review
can be found in \cite{Hajnal2001,Pluim2003}. The Insight Toolkit currently
provides five different implementations of Mutual Information metrics. The
following examples illustrate the practical use of some of these metrics.

\section{ Centered Transforms }

The ITK image coordinate origin is typically located in one of the image
corners. This results in counter-intuitive transform behavior when
rotations and scaling are involved. Users tend to assume that rotations and
scaling are performed around a fixed point at the center of the image.  In
order to compensate for this difference in natural interpretation, a set of
\emph{centered} transforms have been introduced into the toolkit. The following
sections describe the main characteristics of such transforms.

\section{Multi-Resolution Registration}
\label{sec:MultiResolutionRegistration}
Performing image registration using a multi-resolution approach is widely used
to improve speed, accuracy and robustness. The basic idea is that registration
is first performed at a coarse scale where the images have fewer pixels.
The spatial mapping determined at the coarse level is then used to initialize
registration at the next finer scale. This process is repeated until it
reaches the finest possible scale. This coarse-to-fine strategy greatly
improve the registration success rate and also increases robustness
by eliminating local optima at coarser scales.

The Insight Toolkit offers a multi-resolution registration framework that is
directly compatible with all the registration framework components. The
multi-resolution registration framework has two additional components: a pair
of \emph{image pyramids} that are used to down-sample the fixed and moving
images as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:MultiResRegistrationComponents}.
The pyramids smooth and subsample the images according to user-defined
scheduling of shrink factors.
