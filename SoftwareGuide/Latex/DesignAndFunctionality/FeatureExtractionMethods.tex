Extracting salient features from images is an important task on image
processing.  It is typically used for guiding segmentation methods, preparing
data for registration methods, or as a mechanism for recognizing anatomical
structures in images. The following section introduce some of the feature
extraction methods available in ITK.


\subsection{Hough Transform}
\label{sec:HoughtTransform}

The Hough transform is a widely used technique for detection of geometrical
features in images. It is based on mapping the image into a parametric space
in which it may be easier to identify if particular geometrical features are
present in the image. The transformation is specific for each desired
geometrical shape.
