\item [Skull.]
Given that the origins of ITK are with the Visible Human Project, it is
appropriate that the skull was derived from the Visible Woman dataset. The
skull was segmented with ITK from the Visible Woman head CT images with simple
thresholding\footnote{\url{https://github.com/XiaoxiaoLiu/3D-printing}}.

\item[Brain.]
The brain model was segmented with ITK as described in the open science
publication:
