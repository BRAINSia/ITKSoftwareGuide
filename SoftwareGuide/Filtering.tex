\chapter{Filtering}

NOTE: Creating pipelines; pixel, neighborhood, and global filters. Multiple input filters.

This chapter introduces the most commonly used filters in the toolkit.  Most of
these filters are intended to process images. They will accept one or more
images as input and wil produce one or more images as output. Insight is based
on a data pipeline architecture in which the output of one filter is passed as
input to another filter.
